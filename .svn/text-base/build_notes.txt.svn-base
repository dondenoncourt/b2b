Grails-UI was last updated in 2008 and it requires YUI (also last updated in 2008)
But the YUI plugin tries to download a zip from Yahoo that is no longer available
so I downloaded the YUI plugin and removed the Ant copy section in the install script
then I zipped the directory
long story short...

grails install-plugin grails-yui-kettler.zip 

then 
grails install-plugin bubbling 
then  
grails install-plugin grails-ui

Note the YUI install script used to:
    mkdir(dir:"${basedir}/web-app/js/yui/${yuiVersion}")
    copy(todir:"${basedir}/web-app/js/yui/${yuiVersion}") {
        fileset(dir:"${downloadDir}/yui_${yuiVersion}/yui/build", includes:"** / **") denoncourt added spaces to stop the comment from ending
    }
so you need to be sure that web-app/js/yui exists (although it should be in subversion...)

I probably should put grails-yui-kettler in a project and reference it like SharedDomainPlugin
